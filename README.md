Basic workout tracker. My parents need to get in shape. They're in a different country and I'm currently helping them sort out their workouts via google docs. This is not an ideal state of affairs. I've also spent the better part of the last year working primarily on a python2.6/cherrypy project (which may or may not have a whiff of insanity to it). Why not kill two birds with one stone; help my parents not die and practice a bunch of random stuff at the same time.

If you're reading this, I'm not entirely sure what you're doing here, but knock yourself out. Comments welcome. Feature requests welcome. PRs welcome.
